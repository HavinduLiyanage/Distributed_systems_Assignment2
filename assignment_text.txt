Due:	See	due	date	in	Assignments	section	on	Canvas	 Page 2	 ECU Internal Information Background information   A banking transfer system is used by customers to log in to their bank account, view their account balance, and submit transfer requests to send money to another account. In practice, banking systems are complex distributed systems involving multiple clients and servers, security controls, persistent storage, and asynchronous processing (e.g., notifications).  From the technical point of view, a banking transfer system is a distributed system. It typically consists of a client (front end) and one or more servers (application and database). Some operations are naturally synchronous (request/response), while others are often implemented asynchronously (messages/events) to improve reliability and scalability.  Note: No real money is involved in this assignment. This is a teaching system with mock data only.  System overview (three-tier architecture)  You are required to design a small banking system with a three-tier structure:  • Client tier: Banking Client (BC client) Used by customers to sign in, query balance, and submit transfer requests.  • Application tier: Bank Application Server (BAS server) Provides authenticated APIs, implements business rules (fee calculation, validation, state transitions), and coordinates transfer processing.  • Data tier: Bank Database Server (BDB server) Stores persistent data such as user accounts, balances, transfer records, and audit logs. The database server can only be accessed by the BAS server (not by the client).  Communication may be synchronous (e.g., login, view balance) or asynchronous (e.g., notification). You must justify your design choice per operation.  System components  Consider the following simplified system: it consists of one client and two servers.  Client 1 — BC client: This is the customer-facing banking client. A user can use it to: • sign in, • view their balance, and • submit a transfer request and receive a transfer result (or a transfer status).  Details of the BC client behavior and requirements can be found in the “System behaviors and requirements” section.  Server 1 — BAS server: This is the main application server of the bank. It offers primary functions such as: • authentication and session/token management, • balance query,

Server 2 — BDB server: This is the database server used to persist data. It stores: • users, accounts, hashed credentials (or mock secrets), • account balances, • transfer records and their statuses, • fee records and audit logs.  Transfer fee rules (per transfer)  Each transfer is charged on its own amount using the table below. Pick the tier by the transfer amount, compute the percentage on that amount, then apply the per-transfer cap.  Transfer amount per transfer Percentage on this transfer Per-transfer cap Notes $0 – $2,000.00 0% — Free tier $2,000.01 – $10,000.00 0.25% $20.00 Entry tier $10,000.01 – $20,000.00 0.20% $25.00 Mid tier $20,000.01 – $50,000.00 0.125% $40.00 Upper-mid tier $50,000.01 – $100,000.00 0.08% $50.00 High tier $100,000.01 and above 0.05% $100.00 Top tier  •  Cap = maximum fee for a single transfer. •  All monetary values must be rounded to 2 decimal places.  System behaviors and requirements  (A) Login and authentication  The user runs the BC client and enters username/password (mock). The client sends a login request to BAS server. BAS server validates the credentials (mock validation) and returns an authentication result: • success → return a session token / auth token • failure → reject and log the attempt Design requirement: Explain where authentication is handled and how the token is used in subsequent APIs.  (B) Balance query  The BC client sends a balance query request with the user’s token. BAS server authenticates the request, reads current balance from BDB, and returns it. This operation is typically synchronous (request/response). Explain your choice.  (C) Submit a transfer request  A customer provides: 
CSI3344 Distributed Systems  Assignment 2 Summer School, 2026 
Due:	See	due	date	in	Assignments	section	on	Canvas	 Page 4	 ECU Internal Information • recipient account ID (or payee ID), • transfer amount, • an optional reference message.  The BC client allows an authenticated user to submit a transfer request (recipient, amount, optional reference). The BAS server is responsible for enforcing banking rules and maintaining system consistency.  Your design must address (and justify): • Authentication: how the request is authenticated/authorized. • Validation: what input checks are required and how errors are reported. • Fee policy: how the transfer fee is computed using the fee table (per transfer, with caps). • Consistency: how you ensure balances and transfer records remain consistent under failures and concurrent requests. • Processing mode: whether the transfer completes synchronously or is handled asynchronously (e.g., queued settlement), and why. • Persistence & audit: what must be stored in BDB for traceability and later queries (e.g., transfer status/history).  The server must return an outcome that is meaningful to the user (e.g., a confirmed completion or a trackable request), but the exact mechanism is part of your design.  (D) Transfer status query  The BC client can query by transfer ID: • PENDING (accepted but not settled yet) • COMPLETED (funds moved + fee charged) • FAILED (e.g., insufficient funds, invalid recipient, server error; no money deducted)  (E) Persistence and audit  Every transfer must be persisted with necessary information.   This is a teaching system with mock data: • Create and use a small set of mock users/accounts in BDB. • No integration with real banks. • Focus on clear tier separation, authenticated APIs, persistence, and correct fee logic.   Recommended procedure for implementation  It is recommended that you implement the project in two phases. • Phase 1 focuses on a minimal two-tier client–server system (BC client ↔ BAS server). • Phase 2 upgrades the system to a three-tier architecture by adding BDB server as the database tier (BAS server ↔ BDB server). The BDB server can only be accessed by the BAS server (not by the BC client).  Phase 1: Two-tier implementation  
CSI3344 Distributed Systems  Assignment 2 Summer School, 2026 
Due:	See	due	date	in	Assignments	section	on	Canvas	 Page 5	 ECU Internal Information In this phase, implement a basic banking system using BC client + BAS server only, without a separate database tier (BDB). In this phase, you may maintain the system state in-memory on the BAS server (e.g., arrays/dictionaries), i.e., implement the required behaviours without involving the BDB server.   The goal is to demonstrate a clean remote invocation workflow and correct business logic.  Scope (Phase 1) Your system should support the required functions, such as: • Sign-in / authentication • Balance query • Transfer request submission • Transfer fee computation using the provided fee table (per transfer, with caps)  Communication style (choose one): (i) Synchronous (RMI/RPC-style). Use a request/response pattern (e.g., RMI or RPC). Allowed third-party libraries for Style (i): Pyro5 OR gRPC (and their dependencies such as grpcio and grpcio-tools). Apart from these, only the Python standard library is allowed.  (ii) Asynchronous or hybrid. Use asynchronous communication (or a hybrid of synchronous + asynchronous). In this case, you may use third-party libraries/packages. You should clearly define the message/event flow and how your system behaves under failures (e.g., retry, duplicate requests).  Phase 2: Three-tier implementation  Start Phase 2 only after Phase 1 is working. This phase has two sub-tasks:  (1) Testing (required) Extensively test your Phase-1 system using various inputs and edge cases (e.g., boundary values of fee tiers, insufficient funds, invalid recipient, repeated requests).  (2) Add the BDB server and upgrade to three-tier Create BDB server as the database tier and extend the Phase-1 system so that persistent data is stored and queried via the BDB server. In Phase 2, you should use SQLite for the database implementation. The SQLite database must be managed by BDB server program. The BC client and BAS server must not access the database directly.  Communication rule • BC client has no direct access to BDB server. • BAS server ↔ BDB server communication may use RMI/RPC (or your selected mechanism), and you must justify the choice.  Testing  For testing, manually create mock data for at least two users and store them in the database. You should export your database tables (e.g., as .xlsx/.csv) and submit them as a supporting document.

Due:	See	due	date	in	Assignments	section	on	Canvas	 Page 6	 ECU Internal Information You must explain how your design maintains correctness under failures (e.g., partial updates, retries, duplicate requests).  Note: If you complete Phase 2, you do not need to submit Phase 1 separately. Your final submission (code and report) should contain the three-tier (Phase 2) system. In your report, present the complete system design and clearly explain the role of each component you developed, including how your Phase 1 design was extended to Phase 2 (e.g., after adding the BDB server). If you do not complete Phase 2, submit your Phase 1 (two-tier) system as the final deliverable.       The written report  Write a project report about the project you completed.
